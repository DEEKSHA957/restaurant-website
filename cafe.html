A cafeteria, sometimes called a canteen outside the U.S., is a type of food service location in which ,<br/> there is little or no waiting staff table service, whether a restaurant or within an institution such <br />as a large office building or school; a school dining location is also referred to as a dining hall or <br/>lunchroom (in American English). Cafeterias are different from coffeehouses, although the English term<br/> came from Latin American Spanish, where it had and still has the meaning "coffeehouse".</p>
